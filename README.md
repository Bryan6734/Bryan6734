## Hi! I'm Bryan Sukidi.

I'm a student on leave from UNC Chapel Hill, where I was studying Computer Science and Philosophy on a Morehead-Cain scholarship.

I love our species, and I care deeply about making sure that humanity one day has the chance to flourish. I'm mainly interested in reducing catastrophic risks from AI and solving cool problems. I also started a blog.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, playing guitar, and running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel. Please reach out if you'd like to chat. I love making new friends!
